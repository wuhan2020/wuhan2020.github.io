We are witnessing countless lovely technical people who are working around the clock to bring technology more closely to our lives, especially at this moment.

Engineers with technology know-how are fighting pneumonia caused by the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) at the front line and defending the health of human beings with countless lines of codes.

Use the power of open source to build an information hub.

Under the situation of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, utilizing the power of open source to establishing a reliable information hub for information gathering like, the information from hospitals, hotels, manufacturers, and logistics, are the mission of the “wuhan2020” project. This project is initially organized by a group of volunteers who are enthusiastic in opensource development.

At this moment, this project has become the No.1 GitHub Trending globally. Many more volunteers are getting involved in this project every day and contributing to this project in their field of expertise. They use technology to contribute, some submit their own data prediction models, and some responsible in following map component optimization, such as heat maps, time-varying sequence diagrams, etc.
