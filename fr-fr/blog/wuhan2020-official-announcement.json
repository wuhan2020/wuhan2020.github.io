This is an Open Source project constructed and maintained by all of us for a better and more effective collaboration that assists the self-organized rescue.  The things we are working on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to create a data service for real-time synchronization among hospitals, factories and procurement.</li>\n<li>to call on more people to participate in this project with their professional skills and various resources.</li>\n<li>to proceed with our collaborative tasks and constantly stay motivated by the spirit of Open Source community.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The online web entrance of our project: <code>Information Collection Platform for Wuhan 2019-nCoV Epidemic Prevention (in Chinese 新型冠状病毒防疫信息平台)</code> <a href=\"https://wuhan2020.kaiyuanshe.cn/\">https://wuhan2020.kaiyuanshe.cn</a></p>\n<h2>Open Source &amp; Collaboration</h2>\n<p>Thanks for your support, now we already have more than two thousand volunteers.</p>\n<p>Based on the idea of Open Source community:  contribution-oriented role, we don't have a hierarchical management, instead, everyone is equal in this flat structure.</p>\n<p>However, in this tough period, we have to take into account the efficiency and effectiveness, so a certain management method intervention is necessary, like the management by objects, control, coordination and communication.</p>\n<h2>Current Sub-projects and Resources</h2>\n<h3>architecture</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/59fd6438883c5dd1e40a689a02387d61aa12b692/687474703a2f2f6170692e687970657274726f6e732e696f2f756d6c72656e64657265722f6769746875622f777568616e323032302f646174612d73796e633f706174683d7374617469632f6172636869746563747572652e70756d6c\" alt=\"arch\"></p>\n<p>info source： <a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020/data-sync\">https://github.com/wuhan2020/data-sync</a></p>\n<h3>Resources and Sub-projects</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>sub-projects</th>\n<th>links</th>\n<th>#teams</th>\n<th>specification</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>progressive web app</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020/WebApp\">https://github.com/wuhan2020/WebApp</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wuhan2020.slack.com/archives/CSTPXN533\">#proj-front-pages</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wuhan2020.kaiyuanshe.cn/\">https://wuhan2020.kaiyuanshe.cn/</a> frontend source code</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>data synchronization</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020/data-sync\">https://github.com/wuhan2020/data-sync</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://app.slack.com/client/TT5U1VCPQ/CT4AV807P\">#proj-datasync</a></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>API server</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020/api-server\">https://github.com/wuhan2020/api-server</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wuhan2020.slack.com/archives/CT3V5CDKJ\">#proj-api-server</a></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>map visulization component</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020/map-viz\">https://github.com/wuhan2020/map-viz</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://app.slack.com/client/TT5U1VCPQ/CT6HW3X8E\">#team-backend</a></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shimo sync component</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020/shimo-sheet2json\">https://github.com/wuhan2020/shimo-sheet2json</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wuhan2020.slack.com/archives/CT93MCEJK\">#team-backend</a></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>UI documentation</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://shimo.im/docs/6PtqQkXvJjCYwdwj\">https://shimo.im/docs/6PtqQkXvJjCYwdwj</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wuhan2020.slack.com/archives/CT70SHJQ0\">#team-designer</a></td>\n<td>UI design documentation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PRD documentation</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/6oLZ4Swo2He0w8DUNELsUV/wuhan?node-id=0%3A28\">https://www.figma.com/file/6oLZ4Swo2He0w8DUNELsUV/wuhan?node-id=0%3A28</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://wuhan2020.slack.com/archives/CT99VDWS2\">#team-requirement-management</a></td>\n<td>product design documentation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>info source：<a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020/wuhan2020/\">https://github.com/wuhan2020/wuhan2020/</a></p>\n<h2>Project application, Project assignment, Project management</h2>\n<p>We develop core data services for this combat against 2019-nCoV, and provide a robust resource pool. We look forward to all effective sub-projects and teams initialized by individuals and regulated by core team.</p>\n<h3>Project application &amp; Project assignment</h3>\n<p>Core team recruits volunteers and regulates the entire project wuhan2020, including the work for risk avoidance: when someone is about to launch a new sub-project, he or she can create a git repository and then carry out the development; If this sub-project is planned to settle on our <a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020\">Github</a> , evaluation is required. With approval, you can <code>fork</code> it to our project. Or you can directly create a new repository under our project and subsequently make it authorized.</p>\n<p>Meet us on GitHub：<a href=\"http://github.com/wuhan2020\">http://github.com/wuhan2020</a></p>\n<p>For matters concerning the sub-project launch, please contact our core organizer team with specification of project name and function description.</p>\n<p>For those sub-projects that already settled on our <a href=\"https://github.com/wuhan2020\">Github project</a>, we will adequately promote it and meanwhile designate some volunteers to take charge of its operation.</p>\n<p>In case that some inappropriate information (e.g. commercial usage, advertisement, confidential, rebellion, etc. ) is present in a sub-project, or the sub-project retires, we will remove it promptly.</p>\n<p>If a sub-project encounters some problems and difficulties in its implementation, we will provide technically the corresponding support.</p>\n<h3>Project Management and Communication</h3>\n<p><code>Slack</code> is now the main tecnical communication platform，<code>GitHub</code> is our platform of development and collaboration, where our tecnical team mainly settle.
